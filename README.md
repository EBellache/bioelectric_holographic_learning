## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a computational and theoretical framework for the integrative modeling and optimal steering of bioelectric and epigenetic states. Inspired by pioneering work in bioelectric signaling (e.g., Dr. Michael Levin), our approach leverages free-energy gradient optimization, spectral analysis, and adaptive control to enable precise manipulation of biological development, regeneration, and morphogenesis.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Unified Bioelectric-Epigenetic Modeling:** Coupled PDE-based models capturing the interplay between ion-channel activity and epigenetic states.
- **Free-Energy Gradient Learning:** Adaptive learning driven explicitly by free-energy minimization.
- **Goal-Directed Steering via Hessian Curvature:** Stability and emotional-like states derived explicitly from second-order free-energy curvature.
- **Emergence of Self via Representation Learning:** Autoencoder-inspired cortical bottleneck simulations leading to self-aware computational models.
- **Spectral Decomposition:** State analysis using spectral transforms (Gabor wavelets, Heisenberg Fourier) for optimal coherence monitoring.
